# WEB-115 Final Project: Meal Plan Builder

## Project Overview
This is a simple web application created for the WEB-115 Final Project.  
The application allows users to build and customize a weekly meal plan by entering meals for each day of the week (Monday to Sunday) across five meal periods (Breakfast, Snack 1, Lunch, Snack 2, Dinner).

The web page is generated dynamically based on user input and provides options to clear the form, print the planner, or download it as a PDF (via browser print functionality).

## Features
- Collects user personal information: **Name**, **Email**, and **Weekly Goal**.
- Collects meal plan inputs for **7 days** and **5 meals per day**.
- Validates that a **proper email address** is entered before generating the meal plan.
- Generates a new web page displaying the completed meal plan using JavaScript `document.write()`.

- Allows users to **Print** or **Download** the planner using browser print/save functionality.
